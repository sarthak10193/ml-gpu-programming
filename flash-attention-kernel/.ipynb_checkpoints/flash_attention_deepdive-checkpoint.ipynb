    "* Vanilla attention is $O(N^2)$ in runtime and memory. As the need for larger and larger seq lenghts grows, this quadratic relationship is a big bottleneck\n",
    "* Prior attempts have mostly targeted at ideas like FLOPS reduction (sparse attention) using modified versions of attention without taking into account SW-HW co-design.\n",

    "### How\n",
    "Flash Attention V1 is inspired by the `DataMovement is all you need` paper. This paper analyzes the data movement and storage patterns of attention ops. The key takeaway is that vanilla attention is memory-bound (figure 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **IO Aware**: Takes into account the GPU memory hierarchy and compute architecture. Basically move beyond the mathematical / PyTorch formulation of attention and think critically about the target devices (Mi300x, H100, H200 etc) memory and compute properties. \n",
    "    * **Tiling**: To take full advantage of the various memory capacities and bandwidth (HBM, SMEM, L2 Cache, Registers, etc), the attention algorithm is re-organized in a way that doesn't change the end result (ie exact). It uses \"math tricks\" to make the algo tiling compatible. **NOTE:** By default the attention function is not \"tilable\" due to the non-associate and non-distributive nature of the softmax function. More on this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Activation Recomputation**\n",
    "How do you get here ? Using the data movement paper + facts/research observations on Elementiwise vs matmul parts in terms of memory bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, the flash attention algo provides a **fused kernel implememtation** of the original attention function $$O = dropout(mask(softmax(Q \\dot K^T))V))$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Dao et al. introduced FlashAttention, a novel tiling strategy for parallelizing attention that eliminates intermediate\n",
    "reads/writes to slow global memory through fusing all of the attention operations into a single GPU kernel. Dao\n",
    "[15] restructured the algorithm as FlashAttention-2 to also parallelize over the sequence length dimension and\n",

Ex: IN fp16 (2bytes) the max value can only be 65556. Therefore if $x_{i}=12$ then  $e^{12}$ is too large to fit into the dynamic range of FP16. \n",
