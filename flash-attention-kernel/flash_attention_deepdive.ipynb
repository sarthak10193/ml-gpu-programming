    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Flash attention has evolved over the last 3 years with v1, v2 and v3. A table with the key differences is provided at the end of this notebook. \n",

    "- deepseek attention methods\n",
    "- Ohter customization from character ai etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "* Vanilla attentoin is O(N2) ... Elaborated in detail below in the section. \n",
    "* Prior attempts have mostly targeted at ideas like FLOPS reduction (sparse attention) using modified versions of attention without taking into account SW-HW co-design.\n",
    "* More practically\n",
    "    * Larger Sequence Lengths are required if we want to train models with increasing CTX lengths for a variety of use cases. \n",
    "* From a hardware perspective, vanilla attention is memory bound. \n",
    "    * HBM is an order of magnitude slower than SMEM. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How\n",
    "Flash Attention V1 is inspired by the `DataMovement is all you need` paper. This paper critically analyzes the data movement and storage patterns of attention ops. The key takeaway is that vanilla attention is memory-bound (figure 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **IO Aware**: Takes into account the GPU memory hierarchy and compute architecture. Basically move beyond the mathematical / PyTorch formulation of attention and think critically about the target devices (Mi300x, H100, H200 etc) memory and compute properties. \n",
    "    * **Tiling**: To take full advantage of the various memory capacities and bandwidth (HBM, SMEM, L2 Cache, Registers, etc), the attention algorithm is re-organized in a way that doesn't change the end result (ie exact). It is just some \"math tricks\" to make the algo tiling compatible. **NOTE:** By default the attention function is not \"tilable\" due to the non-associate and non-distributive nature of the softmax function. More on this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Activation Recomputation**\n",
    "How do you get here ? Using the data movement paper + facts/research observations on Elementiwise vs matmul parts in terms of memory bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, the flash attention algo provides a **fused kernel implememtation** of the original attention function $$O = dropout(mask(softmax(Q \\dot K^T))V))$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Dao et al. introduced FlashAttention, a novel tiling strategy for parallelizing attention that eliminates intermediate\n",
    "reads/writes to slow global memory through fusing all of the attention operations into a single GPU kernel. Dao\n",
    "[15] restructured the algorithm as FlashAttention-2 to also parallelize over the sequence length dimension and\n",
    "perform the inner loop of the forward pass over blocks of the key and value matrices, thus improving the occupancy\n",

    "## Vanilla Attention \n",
    "### Formulation\n",
    "Remember that the IO unaware formulation of attention is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Let } Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d} \\text{ be the query, key and value input sequences}$\n",
    "$ \\text{associated to a single head, where } N \\text{ is the sequence length and } d \\text{ is the} $\n",
    "$ \\text{head dimension. Then the attention output } O \\text{ is computed as:} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "& S = \\alpha QK^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, && \\\\ \n",
    "& P = \\text{softmax}(S) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, && \\\\ \n",
    "& O = PV \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}, &&\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then give B Batches and H heads (MHA) for each of Q, K, V we get the following shapes: \n",
    "* Q: `[BatchSize (B), NumHeads (H), Seq Len (N), Embedding Dim (d)]`\n",
    "* K: `[BatchSize (B), NumHeads (H), Seq Len (N), Embedding Dim (d)]`\n",
    "* V: `[BatchSize (B), NumHeads (H), Seq Len (N), Embedding Dim (d)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can parallelize the GeMM across BATCH and HEAD dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I - Attention is $O (N^2)$ \n",
    "1. **Memory Bound**:  Standard computation would require 6 trips (3 loads and 3 stores) from the HBM and is memory bound. \n",
    "    * Load $Q$ & $K$ --> compute $X = Q \\dot K^T$ --> Store $X$     \n",
    "    * Load $X$ --> compute $A = softmax(X)$ --> Store $A$\n",
    "    * Load $A$, $V$ --> compute $O = X  V$ --> Store $O$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add the distribution of time vs flops chart here. Link to glossary. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Materiallization**: If L is too large (for say a million context length) then it would **NOT be possible** at all to fit the entire $Q \\dot K^T$ in the `SMEM`.\n",
    "3. **Safe Softmax** Additionally in the real world we use  `Safe Softmax` operation. Safe Softmax **subtracts the MAX values to avoid overflow  and underflow** given a certain bit-width. Ex: IN fp16 (2bytes) the max value can only be 65556. Therefore if $x_{i}=12$ then  $e^{12}$ is too large to fit into the dynamic range of FP16. \n",
    "    * fp16 is with: `1 signed bit |  5 exponent bits |  10 mantissa` therefore very high precision but lower dynamic range \n",
    "    * bf16 is with: `1 signed bit |  8 exponent bits | 7 mantissa bit`  therefore very low precision but higher dynamic range\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Safe Softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i - M}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_j - M}} \\quad \\text{where } M = \\text{max} (x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing the Limiations\n",
    "1. Tiling\n",
    "Matrix Mul Op have the nice property of **Associativity** & **Distributivity**. Therefore the $Q \\dot K^T$ can be tiled achieving massive paralllism on GPUs. \n",
    "2. However, the subsequent operation `SOFTMAX` CANNOT be tiled. Additionally, using the 'Safe Softmax' operations requires us to scan the entire sequence length for the max value. "

    "2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **implication / advantage of doing Online Softmax** is that equation (7) and equation (8) can be fused since you don't require $m_{N}$ any more and only require $m_{i}$ and $m_{i-1}$. All of this is hinged on the fact that $d_{N} == d^{`}_{N}$"
